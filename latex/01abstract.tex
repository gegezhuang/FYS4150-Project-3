We have investigated the resonance of particles in an idealized penning trap with a time-dependent electric potential. To accomplish this, we have run penning trap-simulations with $\text{Ca}^{+}$-ions for electric potentials with different frequencies and amplitudes. Through these simulations we find the resonance frequencies of the calcium particles in the penning trap. We proceed to run more simulations with 100 $\text{Ca}^{+}$-ions with coulomb interactions between particles for a resonance frequency. We ultimately find that the particle interactions disrupt the resonance of the $\text{Ca}^{+}$-ions in the penning trap.
