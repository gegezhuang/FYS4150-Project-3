To test our implementation, we want to find a specific analytical solution given some initial conditions, and compare this with what our numerical approach gives us. Let us therefore assume we have a single charges particle in our Penning trap, with
%
\begin{align*}
x(0) = x_0, \quad \dot x(0) = 0, &\quad y(0) = 0, \quad \dot y(0) = v_0, \\
z(0) = z_0, \text{ an}&\text{d} \quad \dot z(0) = 0.
\end{align*}
%
Next, we find the general analytical solution for the $z$-axis by rewriting (\ref{eq:ode_z}) as two first order differential equations
%
\begin{align}
\dot z_0 = z_1, \text{ and } \dot z_1 = - \omega_z^2 z_0
\label{eq:ode_z_coupled}
\end{align}
%
where $z_0 = z$, and $z_1 = \dot z$.
