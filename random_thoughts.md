# Problem 10

## Why does the amplitude matter?

-   Given that the particles oscillate harmonically around the trap axis inside the trap:
    it makes a sense that they would be _more_ trapped in some amplitues as compared to others?
-   If the above is correct, it would be natural that a period that always pushes in would be
    a effective at trapping the particles, while one that is not in sync would be less so

# General

## Likelihood of particle spawning outside

-   Probability is `0.999999999997440` (`1` in `390682215445 `) for `7σ`
-   [68–95–99.7 rule (standard deviations up to 7σ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule)
