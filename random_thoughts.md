# Problem 10

## Why does the amplitude matter?

-   Given that the particles oscillate harmonically around the trap axis inside the trap:
    it makes a sense that they would be _more_ trapped in some amplitues as compared to others?
-   If the above is correct, it would be natural that a period that always pushes in would be
    a effective at trapping the particles, while one that is not in sync would be less so
